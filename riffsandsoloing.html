<h1>Riffs and Soloing</h1>
<h2>Reading Tablature</h2>
    <p>Tablature (tab for short) is how guitarists read music.  We use tab because traditional written music is not very helpful to guitarist.  Instead of telling us what note to play like traditional music, tab tells us what fret to play what string on.  Tablature works very similar to chord diagrams, in that it tells us what string to play ad how it should be fingered.  Tab has six horizontal lines representing the six strings of a guitar.  The top string represents the highest pitched string, the High E, while the bottem string represents the lowest pitched string represents the lowest pitch string, the Low E.  The numbers on the lines represent what fret should be played on each string.</p>

<h2>Scales</h2>
    <p>*This is very difficult to understand from reading. It is much easier to understand when in person.</p>
    <h4>Major Scales</h4>
    <p>A scale is any set of notes, ordered in either accending or decending order, based on pitch within an octave. Major scales follow a set pattern, as follows, from any note:Whole Step, Whole Step, Half Step, Whole Step, Whole Step, Whole Step, Half Step.  What this means is you would start with any random note, and go through the pattern playing all eight notes to complete the scale.  The notes of a scale can be played in any order whatsoever and it will sound good.  This is the basis of improvising and soloing.</p>
    <h4>Pentatonic Scales</h4>
        <p>A pentatonic scale uses five notes of an octave instead of eight like the major scale. On the guitar, to play a pentatonic, you would play any note on the Low E string, then play the note 3 half steps higher.  After this you would go to the A string and go up a whole step. You would do this for both the D and G strings.  After this you would go the the same fret as before and go down 3 half steps again.  You would repeat this for the High E string.  This sound complicated reading this, but in practice its not hard to understand.</p>

<h2>Hammer-Ons and Pull-Offs</h2>
    <h4>Hammer-Ons</h4>
        <p>Hammer-Ons are when, instead of playing a string normally, you pluck the string, then fret the note.  This give the illusion that two notes are being played simultaneously.</p>
    <h4>Pull-Offs</h4>
        <p>Pull-Offs are the exact opposite of Hammer-Ons.  Instead of fretting the string after it has been played, you must fret the string then unfret the string as it sounds.  This gives the note a similar effect as to Hammer-Ons.</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>I only have one tip, don't be afraid to make a mistake.  The great thing about soloing is that if you mess up, its really easy to play it off like you meant to do what you did.</p>
