<h1>Matt's Guitar</h1>
<h2>Anatomy of Guitars</h2>
    <h3>Headstock</h3>
        <p>The headstock is the very top of the guitar where the tuners are positioned.  This is where the strings connect with the rest of the guitar.</p>
    <h3>Neck and Frets</h3>
        <p>The neck is the long piece of wood connecting the headstock to the body of the guitar. On the anterior side of the guitar are the frets, the metal pieces that seperate what notes are being played.</p>
    <h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>The strings run along the length of the neck. When they are strummed or plucked, the vibration makes the sound.</p>
    <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>The body is the biggest part of the guitar. It is the large hollow box-like piece at the bottem of the guitar.  Inside the body, the vibrations echo, amplifying the sound. The body is the most important part of the guitar.</p>

<h2>Types of Guitars</h2>
    <p>*There are hundreds more, but this is a good overview of some of the more popular guitar types*</p>
    <h3>Accoustic</h3>
        <h4>Dreadnought</h4>
            <p>I personally would recomend dreadnoughts for begineers because of their versitility.  No matter what genre is being played, dreadnoughts sound good.  Dreadnoughts have large, rectangular bodies which lets them produce loud, full, brash sounds. This is beneficial to begineers because can aid in teaching the student volume control, while also making their mistakes more noticable to the trained ear allowing them to identify and correct their problems.  I personally usually play a dreadnought.</p>

        <h4>Parlour</h4>
            <p>The parlour is the exact opposite of the dreadnought. The parlour has a skinny, round-shaped body which allows it to produce a soft, mellow sound.  Parlours are the smallest guitars on the market (other than modern "baby" guitars that no self respecting guitarist would ever touch.)</p>

        <h4>Auditorium</h4>
            <p>The auditorium is almost the perfect middleground between the dreadnought and the parlour.  The auditorium combines the pros of both the parlour and the dreadnought. 
            The auditorium is a good choice for folk music and for fingerpicked music.</p>

    <h3>Electric</h3>
        <h4>Les Paul</h4>
            <p>The Les Paul is a solid bodied electric with a single cutaway. The Les Paul has a  hard, "punchy" sound perfect for rock and metal.</p>
    <img src="https://images.samash.com/sa/ENS/ENSLPSTD.fpx?cvt=jpg">
        <h4>Hollowbody</h4>
            <p>The Hollowbody is exactly what it sounds like. This guitar has a hollow body which allows for the sound to vibrate inside the body. This makes it where, when unpluged, this electric guitar sounds similar to an acoustic. They offer a mellow, clean sound making these perfect for just about anything.  Hollowbodies often have  a high price tag, but they are worth every penny. Semihollowbodies (thinner versions of hollowbodies) often are significantly cheaper, but when unpluged do not sound quite as good as a true hollowbody.</p>

        <h4>Telocaster</h4>
            <p>Teles have solid bodies and solid coil pickups which make them perfect for just about anything.  A telecaster will sound good playing anything from country twang to heavy metal.</p>

<h2>Basic Tips for Begineers</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Before Playing, Dip your Fingertips into Rubbing Alchol. This drys out the skin making it easier to build calloses.</li>
        <li>ALWAYS tune your instrument before playing.</li>
        <li>Don't watch yourself make the chords. Close your eyes when you practice. You will be suprised by just how much you can do when not looking.</li>
        <li>Don't overthink it. A lot of the problems new guitarists have it psyching themselves out before playing. If you make a mistake listen to what you did wrong, and try not to do it again.</li></ul>
